# CS255
This is an excerpt of my work in CS255 System Analysis and Design
Driver Pass was a client needing a software system to help with the running of their Driving School. 
They wanted a web based system that their customers could access to more easily engage with the products offered. 
I think I did particularly well with the Requirements Document but my presentation and graphics were not so polished. I would spend more time creating the UML class diagram if I could.
Considering the clientâ€™s needs is paramount since they are the ones you are building the system for. We work for the client and help them to realize their business goals through software. 
In the future I will approach designing software with much more care and structure. Where before I would jump in and start coding now I will check for functional and nonfunctional requirements. I will create use case, class, and sequence diagrams to understand the functionality well. I'll consider security ahead of time and communicate better with my team and clients.
